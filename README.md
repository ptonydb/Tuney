# Tuney
 Music Bot for discord to be used with YouTube and similar streaming services. When the bot is running, use !help to learn how to use it.
 
## Getting Started
To begin, you will be needing Python 3.5+ installed on the machine.

Additionally, you will also be required to have to newest versions of youtube-dl, youtube_search, PyNaCl, and discord.py.

```pip install -U youtube-dl youtube_search discord pynacl```
 
## Configuration

The most important piece here is the discord's bot token. Since I will not be providing this bot as a commercial service. You will need to host the bot on another server with your own token provided by [discord](https://discord.com/developers/). This token is referenced in the config file and passed into ***runbot.py*** during runtime.

## Commands
```!help``` will show the following available commands.
